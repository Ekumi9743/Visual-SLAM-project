SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a method often used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. SLAM algorithms allow the vehicle to map out unknown environments. Engineers use the map information to carry out tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.

In this project, I will first use the dataset provided by TUM RGB-D benchmark to run a test model for SLAM. You can find all the information and results for this test in the "Step1" folder.

For step 2, I will create a dataset about one scene of my choice. You can find all the information and results in the "Step2" folder.
