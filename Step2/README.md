## Step 2

The code for step 2 is in the "Code" file.

For step 2 you can check all the output and result by open the "S2.X.png" or "output.png" file. The "prove.jpg" file is a photo that prove this model was made by myself.

For full summary report, you can open "Summary Report.md" file.

Also the whole code design is based on the MATLAB example, you can check the example through the link below:
