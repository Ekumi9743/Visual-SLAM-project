## Method for visual-SLAM application

For step 2, I will create a dataset about one scene of my choice. In this part, I will first replace the dataset in step 1 and run the images I need to process in SLAM. Use the sample provided, reconstruct the scene from image, predict and camera trajectory. Also in step 2, I will skip the ground truth because it is hard for me to acquire that. Then I will compare the final output with step 1 to determine its feasibility.
