## Step 1 TUM RGB-D benchmark

For step 1, I will use the examble codes from MATLAB website below. You can see the code from "code" file.

    https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/monocular-visual-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping.html

After read the webpage of the example, I summarized the main steps of how their Visual-SLAM is implemented. You can check the summary in the "Summary.md" file.

After running the codes, we can get the output model. You can check all the process image from the "png" files.

I will also dicuss about how I will implement a visual-SLAM application myself in the "Method.md" file.
